Prediction model for PSF

In the experiment, to extract the proximity effect parameters, an exposure layout comprising of box structures and dots on PMMA coated Silicon substrate is patterned. The box structures are used to determine the clearing dose. A sequence of dotarray is patterned with each dot receiving more exposure dose than the preceding dot. After development, the radii of the dots are measured. The obtained areas and radii are used to determine the proximity effect parameters via point spread function (PSF) fitting. The PSF is used to model the energy-deposition distribution of the electrons from the initial incident exposure point and is approximated by the sum of two (or more) Gaussian functions (Chang., 1975). 
Predictive modeling based on experimental data set is used to calculate PSF for structure characteristics different from those available in the experiment.
